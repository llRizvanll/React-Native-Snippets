# Assignment 5: Advanced UI & Micro-interactions

## Topic
Mastering Layout Animations and Gesture-based interactions.

## Problem Statement
Build a high-performance "Media Gallery" with shared element transitions and gesture-based interactions. This assignment focuses on UI fluidity and professional-grade micro-interactions in React Native.

## Objectives
- **Key Tech**: `react-native-reanimated`, `react-native-gesture-handler`.
- **Features**: 
    - **Shared Element Transitions**: Smooth hero image transitions between list and detail views.
    - **Pinch-to-Zoom**: Implement pinch-to-zoom logic on images using Reanimated.
    - **Swipe-to-Dismiss**: Gesture-based details view dismissal.
- **Architecture**: Advanced ViewModel patterns for gesture state synchronization.

## Technical Goals
- Deep dive into `worklets` and the Reanimated UI thread.
- Handling complex gesture states simultaneously.
- Optimizing layout animations for a premium feel.
